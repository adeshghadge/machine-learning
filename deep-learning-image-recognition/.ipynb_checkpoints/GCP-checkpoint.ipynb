Once you sign up you will be able to spin up Virtual Machine Instances under the Compute Engine service. But in order to really utilize the power of GPUs you will need to take some additional steps. I will get to them as we move through the setup process."

    "In order to train YOLO we will need a GPU powered VM instance. Google does not provide a GPU when you sign up. You will need to request a quota increase (by default the GPU quota is set to 0). Once you place the request Google will ask your permission to charge your credit card if you go beyond`$300` credit that was given to you when you signed up. Be careful here because when you spin up a machine you will need to keep an eye out on the resources it consumes or you will end up getting a big bill. For the YOLO training and testing I ended up paying around $20 or so."

Not all locations have GPUs available so you will need to confirm in GCP help (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/#introduction). Once you select your location then select the checkbox for NVIDIA K80 GPU. Then click on the link at the top of the page which says Edit Quotas. This will open a panel where you will submit the request. Google gets back pretty quickly but they say within 2-3 business days."
